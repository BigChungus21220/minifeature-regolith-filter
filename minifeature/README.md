features:
- feature file generation
- inline features
- backwards compatability with vanilla features
- easily extendable feature set

bugs:
- feature rules are placed in folders (test if this works)

planned features:
- more vanilla feature types
    - ore - done
    - structure - done
    - growing plant - done
    - trees (maybe)
    - geode
    - vegetation patch
    - carvers
- conditional_list feature type
- block test feature (maybe)
- dependency tree analysis for error recovery / more warnings
    - if not a dependency of a feature rule, don't build (probably want some way to allow building with some config)

future features:
- json-ui like inheritance
- json-ui like variables
- advanced molang support
